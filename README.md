## Topic
The two scenarios that are supported by the system and that were investigated was:

• Does income affect the sentiment of public transport tweets

• Does public transport usage affect the sentiment of public transport tweets

Both analyses of these can be seen in the system on their respective webpage maps, as well as the
correlation webpage.
Both analyses found inversely proportional relationships, indicating that wealthy and high public
transport usage area are more likely to tweet negatively about public transport in their areas.
